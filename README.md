Hello Universe,

Kaela Jeter is here. I love nature, music, poetry, art, math, science, sports, dancing, traveling, and my daughter. My favorite color changes like the season but currently is pink on a good day and orange on others. I know basoc French, Spanish, and can say 1 to 10 in Vietnemese. I use to take ASL along with attending their events in college. Networking is like my second language; I started networking as soon as I got a phone as much as I could. I wasn't able to model until I turned 17. once I graduated from college. I attended a couple movie scenes as an extra, which was very exciting. CUrrently Im back into school learning more about computers and different networking oppurtunities throughh this business. I'm excited for my future, I can feel the good in all of it before the success.
